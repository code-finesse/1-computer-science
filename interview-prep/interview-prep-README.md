# Heading

This is the repository that holds all of the knowledge that can help you do well in technical interviews. As this is a huge and ever-evolving topic, there will be a lot of information that is missing. 

This readme file will be the table of contents for different kinds of technical problems. The biggest part of doing a technical problem is to understand the patterns, constraints, and goals.

In order to understand the implementation of certain things and more in depth understanding of specific problems, you can go to the [coding-challenges](https://github.com/code-finesse/coding-challenges) repository. That is where you can find individual problems, their solutions, and some comments explaining the thought process of the code.
