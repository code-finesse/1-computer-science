| Label | Name | Description |
|--|--|--|
| O(1) | Constant |  |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic |  |
| O(n) | Linear |  |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic |  |
|  |  |  |
| O(2n^n) | Exponential |  |
| O(n^n) | ?? |  |
| O(n!) | Factorial |  |

```javascript
  // O(1)
  const s = 4 + 3
```


## Extra Things to Note
Users should keep these things in mind. Let them know things won't work unless they have done these
* In order to visualize the database you nee to have a frontend with this
