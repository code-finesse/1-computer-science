  ## **What is an Algorithm?**
  Simply put, an algorithm is a process. And like any process, an algorithm contains a set of steps you take in order to achieve a specific goal.

  Here are some algorithims we encounter in our daily lives!

- There may be several different algorithms that can sort or find a value in a data set, and some of these may execute more quickly than others. Studying algorithms gives us the knowledge we need to find the best way to approach a problem.

- No matter its use, an algorithm is simply a set of instructions that tells a computer how to solve a problem.

- A search algorithm retrieves information stored within a data structure.

- A sorting algorithm puts elements in a list in a certain order. This might sound simple, but when your data set has thousands, or even millions, of different items, it gets much more difficult.

- Algorithms are evaluated based on their computational complexity, or the amount of resources it takes to run them. Those resources include:

    - **Time**: The maximum amount of time it would take the algorithm to solve a problem.

    - **Space**: The maximum amount of computer memory, or RAM, the algorithm needs to run.

- Space: The maximum amount of computer memory, or RAM, the algorithm needs to run.
